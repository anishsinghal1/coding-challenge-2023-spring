I set out to find out the distribution of the temperature of the stars in the dataset. To do this, I created a histogram in Python using the pandas and matplotlib libraries. I imported the csv file of the star dataset into python using pandas, and created a histogram plot using matplotlib. The visualization shows that the vast majority of stars in the dataset have a temperature below approximately 5000 degrees Kelvin.
